# Synthetic Seismocardiogram Generation Using a Transformer-Based Neural Network
Our objective was o design and validate a novel seismocardiogram (SCG) denoising model with a specific focus on reducing the impact of walking noise. SCG signals are noninvasively obtained cardiomechanical signals that contain important features for cardiovascular health parameter monitoring tasks. However, these signals are prone to contamination by motion noise, which can significantly impact the accuracy of monitoring processes.

A deep learning model based on the U-Net neural network architecture is proposed to restore SCG signals by removing motion noise induced by walking. The performance of the model was evaluated through qualitative analysis, involving visualizing the heart beats, and quantitative analysis, involving calculating distance metrics. Additionally, the model’s effectiveness was assessed by examining its performance in downstream tasks related to health parameter estimation.

The experimental findings revealed that the denoising process resulted in approximately 90% improved similarity to clean signals. The performance of the model in enhancing the heart rate estimation task demonstrated a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.21 BPM or lower, and a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 2.18 BPM or lower during walking. Furthermore, the accuracy of the AO and AC extraction after denoising exhibited differences in ∆RM SE of 0.73 ms and 4.55 ms during walking compared to clean beats, respectively

## Overview
Overview of the Seismocardiogram (SCG) denoising model. (a) A noisy sample of SCG signal recorded during walking, which is fed as input to the denoising model. (b, c) The model receives a noisy SCG signal and outputs an SCG signal with a lower noise level. (d) This enables the development of algorithms for downstream tasks that use SCG signals.

## Architecture 

Architecture of the SCG denoising model, which is adapted from the Noise2Noise architecture for removing motion noise from SCG signals. (a) A 2s window sample of SCG signal during walking is fed into the network as input. (b, c) The timeseries input is transformed using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to create a scalogram image. (d) The scalogram image is fed to the U-Net and the output of the U-Net is subtracted from the input image to create a denoised scalogram image. (e, f) The estimated denoised image is transformed back to a 2s timeseries which is the model prediction of the denoised SCG signal.

The top plots represent the continuous heart rate (HR), pre-ejection period (PEP), and left ventricular ejection time (LVET) values obtained after applying the denoising model. The bottom images display the beat stack images, illustrating the collection of beats from the entire study duration before and after denoising. The aortic opening (AO) and aortic closing (AC) features are highlighted in red and blue, respectively.

 ## Conclusion
 
In this study, we developed and validated a novel denoising model using the U-Net architecture, specifically designed to reduce walking noise from SCG signals while preserving cardiac information. The application of this model has the potential to enable accurate monitoring of health parameters using SCG signals during various activities. By mitigating the barriers associated with noise in SCG signals, this technology can facilitate the use of SCG in remote monitoring and telehealth, allowing for enhanced identification of abnormalities, tracking of disease progression, and optimization of therapeutic interventions. Overall, the proposed model holds promise for improving cardiovascular health monitoring and enhancing patient care.
